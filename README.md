There are two ways we will cover on how to run this example app: Codespace or locally. 

## Getting Started via Codespace
1. Git clone this repo

> Note: You can also open this repo in a Codespace

2. Open a terminal in the directory and make sure the dependancies are installed with the commands below 

```bash
python -m pip install Django
pip install python-dotenv
pip install pangea-django
```

3. Rename `.env.example` into `.env`

<br>

4. Fill out the tokens & values found in .env with the values found in the Pangea AuthN Overview page

>Note: Copy the Forwarded Address from the Ports Section of the terminal in the Codespace
